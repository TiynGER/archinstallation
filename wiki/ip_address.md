# IP Address

The IP address is a numerical label for a computer that is connected to a network using the
Internet Protocol (IP).
There are two versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

## Geo-blocking

Geo-blocking is the practice that restricts access to internet sites or content using information on
the users location.
This location is often obtained using the IP address.

Geo-blocking can be evaded by using a [VPN service](/wiki/vpn.md).
Sometimes the IP addresses that are used by VPNs are blocked by websites.
To avoid this a spoofing tool like [Chameleon](/wiki/chameleon.md) for [Firefox](/wiki/firefox.md)
can be used.

using the German Bundesliga in Brazil as an example.
Please note that using the VPN for this may violate terms and services accepted by subscribing to
a VPN service.
