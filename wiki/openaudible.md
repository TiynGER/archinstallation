# OpenAudible

[OpenAudible](https://openaudible.org/) is a cross-platform audiobook manager for the audible
audiobook and podcast service.

## Setup

The software can be setup via installation files for [Windows](/wiki/windows.md), Mac and 
[Linux](/wiki/linux.md) that are available on the
[official website](https://openaudible.org/download).
Linux distributions may aswell feature a package.

After the installation the user has to connect OpenAudible with Audible.
The `Connect to Audible` button is available under the `Controls` tab.

## Usage

This section describes various topics regarding the usage of OpenAudible.

### Downloading, Converting and Splitting Audiobooks

To download, convert or split an audiobook first make sure OpenAudible is connected with Audible as
described in the [setup section](#setup).
Also a library sync can be useful if the target audiobook doesn't show up in the list at the bottom
of the window.
A sync can be started by pressing the `Quick Audible Library Sync` button under the `Controls` tab.

To download locate the audiobook in the list of audiobooks, right-click it and select `Download`.
After the download it can be converted to `.mp3` or `.m4b` by selecting the corresponding option in
the right-click menu.
The same way the audiobook can be split.

### Licensing and Avoiding It

OpenAudible is a licensed product.
The first year after installation the new versions can be downloaded and used without charge.
However the versions that come out after this year are subject to the purchase of a license to use
them.
This means that the last version that was released before the end of the first year can be used
indefinitely.
This effectively lets the user use all features like
[converting and splitting audiobooks](#downloading-converting-and-splitting-audiobooks) that are
otherwise bound to a valid license.
