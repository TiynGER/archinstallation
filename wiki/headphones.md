# Headphones

Headphones are a pair of drivers that converts electronic signals into [audio](/wiki/audio.md).
Headphones are available in different forms: for example headphones and in-ear monitors.
All types are addressed in this article.

## Audio Profiles and Reviews

Headphones have different frequency responses.
[AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master) can be used to normalize these to a
harman curve.
AutoEq also has a [website](https://autoeq.app/) on which headsets can be searched and equalizer
presets can be exported more easily.

An extensive list of in-ear monitor reviews was made by crinacle.
It is called [crinacle's ranking list IEMs & Earphones](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/).
A similar list for headphones was also made by crinacle.

## Modifications

Headphones can be modified.
The most done modifications include detachable cables or a
[balanced](/wiki/audio.md#balanced-unbalanced-audio) conversion.
For every modification that changes the wires on the driver it is important to check the polarity,
aswell as the left and right side to avoid having to resolder any connection.

The following is a list of resources that can be used to mod headphones.
