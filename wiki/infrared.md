# Infrared

Infrared - short IR - is electromagnetic radiation that is used in many technical applications.

## Remote Controls

Many remote controls use infrared.
A simple explanation for the widely used pronto format was explained in an
[article by hifi-remote](http://www.hifi-remote.com/infrared/IR-PWM.shtml).
A more technical explanation of the signals of different formats can be found in an
[article by vishay](https://www.vishay.com/docs/80071/dataform.pdf).

Devices by different vendors usually use different codes.
There are different databases.
The following is a list of resources.

- [JP1 Forum](https://www.getzweb.net/jp1/) is a community that shares files for different devices.
  Some like the
  [Dyson codes](http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=101540&sid=807339ebbff2ee3938d6d3784cecd24e)
  are a bit more hidden in forum posts.
- [Remote Central](https://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/codes/) also has a huge database.
- [ghartwells SMSL repository](https://github.com/ghartwell/SMSL/tree/master) features many SMSL
  IR codes.
- [RCoid](https://www.rcoid.de/remotefiles.html) features some ready made rcf files.
  Despite this format they can be opened with a text editor and searched for codes by hand.
